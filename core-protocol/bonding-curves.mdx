description: "Understand how bonding curves calculate token prices"
---

Bonding curves provide automated price discovery for tokens without requiring traditional liquidity pools. The FunPump SDK supports multiple curve types for different pricing strategies.

## How bonding curves work

A bonding curve is a mathematical function that determines the price of a token based on its supply. As more tokens are purchased, the price increases along the curve. When tokens are sold, the price decreases.

### Constant product curve

The constant product curve uses the formula `x * y = k`, where:
- `x` = virtual token reserves
- `y` = virtual SOL reserves
- `k` = constant product

This is the same curve used by Uniswap and provides stable price discovery.

```typescript
curve: CurveType.ConstantProduct
```

### Linear curve

The linear curve provides predictable price progression with a constant rate of change.

```typescript
curve: CurveType.Linear
```

## Query bonding curve state

Get the current state of a bonding curve.

```typescript
const bondingCurve = await sdk.core.getBondingCurve(tokenMint);

console.log('Virtual Token Reserves:', bondingCurve.virtualTokenReserves.toString());
console.log('Virtual SOL Reserves:', bondingCurve.virtualSolReserves.toString());
console.log('Curve Type:', bondingCurve.curveType);
console.log('Is Completed:', bondingCurve.isCompleted);
console.log('Migrated to Raydium:', bondingCurve.migratedToRaydium);
```

## Bonding curve properties

<ParamField path="virtualTokenReserves" type="BN">
  The virtual token reserves used for price calculation.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="virtualSolReserves" type="BN">
  The virtual SOL reserves used for price calculation.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="realTokenReserves" type="BN">
  The actual token reserves in the curve.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="realSolReserves" type="BN">
  The actual SOL reserves in the curve.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="curveType" type="CurveType">
  The type of bonding curve (ConstantProduct or Linear).
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="isCompleted" type="boolean">
  Whether the bonding curve has reached its completion threshold.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="migratedToRaydium" type="boolean">
  Whether the liquidity has been migrated to Raydium.
</ParamField>

## Calculate prices

Calculate the price for buying or selling tokens.

```typescript
// Calculate buy price for 100k tokens
const buyPrice = await sdk.core.calculateBuyPrice(
  tokenMint,
  new BN(100_000 * 1e9)
);

// Calculate sell price for 100k tokens
const sellPrice = await sdk.core.calculateSellPrice(
  tokenMint,
  new BN(100_000 * 1e9)
);
```

## Raydium migration

When a bonding curve reaches its completion threshold, the liquidity can be migrated to Raydium for traditional AMM trading.

```typescript
const migrationIx = await sdk.core.migrateToRaydium(tokenMint);

const tx = new Transaction().add(migrationIx);
await sendAndConfirmTransaction(connection, tx, [wallet]);
```
