## Quick example

Launch a token with a bonding curve in just a few lines of code.

```typescript
import { BN } from '@coral-xyz/anchor';
import { LaunchPlatform, CurveType } from '@funpump/sdk';

const { instruction, tokenMint } = await sdk.core.launchToken({
  creator: wallet.publicKey,
  name: 'My Token',
  symbol: 'MTK',
  uri: 'https://arweave.net/metadata',
  decimals: 9,
  supply: new BN(1_000_000_000).mul(new BN(10).pow(new BN(9))),
  initialSolReserves: new BN(1).mul(new BN(10).pow(new BN(9))),
  platform: LaunchPlatform.FunPump,
  curve: CurveType.ConstantProduct,
});
```

## Supported platforms

The SDK supports multiple launch platforms:

- **FunPump** - Native FunPump protocol with full feature support
- **PumpFun** - Integration with Pump.fun for broader compatibility

## Curve types

Choose from multiple bonding curve implementations:

- **Constant Product** - x * y = k curve for stable price discovery
- **Linear** - Linear price progression for predictable pricing
