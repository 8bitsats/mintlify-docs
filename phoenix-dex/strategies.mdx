Optimize your market making performance with advanced price strategies. Configure how your market maker quotes prices, improves on existing orders, and responds to market conditions.

## Price improvement behaviors

### Dime improvement

Improve by the minimum tick size to get priority over existing orders.

```typescript
priceImprovementBehavior: 'dime'
```

This strategy places your orders one tick better than the best existing quote, giving you priority in the order book.

### Join best quote

Match the best existing quote without improving.

```typescript
priceImprovementBehavior: 'join'
```

This strategy matches the best existing quote, sharing priority with other orders at that price level.

### Ignore existing quotes

Place orders without considering existing quotes.

```typescript
priceImprovementBehavior: 'ignore'
```

This strategy places orders at your configured spread regardless of existing quotes.

## Dynamic spread adjustment

Automatically adjust spreads based on market conditions.

```typescript
const config = {
  market: marketPublicKey,
  quoteEdgeInBps: 30, // Base spread
  quoteSizeInQuoteAtoms: 1_000_000_000,
  postOnly: true,
  priceImprovementBehavior: 'dime',
  dynamicSpreads: true,
  minSpreadBps: 15, // Minimum spread
  maxSpreadBps: 60, // Maximum spread
  volatilityMultiplier: 1.5, // Widen spreads during volatility
};
```

## Inventory-based pricing

Adjust quotes based on current inventory levels.

```typescript
const config = {
  market: marketPublicKey,
  quoteEdgeInBps: 30,
  quoteSizeInQuoteAtoms: 1_000_000_000,
  postOnly: true,
  priceImprovementBehavior: 'join',
  inventorySkew: true,
  inventoryTarget: 50, // Target 50% inventory
  skewMultiplier: 0.5, // Skew quotes by 0.5% per 10% deviation
};
```

## Adverse selection protection

Protect against adverse selection with smart quoting.

```typescript
const config = {
  market: marketPublicKey,
  quoteEdgeInBps: 30,
  quoteSizeInQuoteAtoms: 1_000_000_000,
  postOnly: true,
  priceImprovementBehavior: 'dime',
  adverseSelectionProtection: true,
  minTimeInBook: 100, // Minimum time in book (ms)
  cancelOnTrade: true, // Cancel opposite side on trade
};
```

## Strategy examples

### Conservative strategy

Tight spreads with frequent requoting.

```typescript
const config = {
  market: marketPublicKey,
  quoteEdgeInBps: 15,
  quoteSizeInQuoteAtoms: 500_000_000,
  postOnly: true,
  priceImprovementBehavior: 'dime',
  dynamicSpreads: false,
  requoteInterval: 1000, // Requote every second
};
```

### Aggressive strategy

Wide spreads with large positions.

```typescript
const config = {
  market: marketPublicKey,
  quoteEdgeInBps: 50,
  quoteSizeInQuoteAtoms: 5_000_000_000,
  postOnly: false,
  priceImprovementBehavior: 'join',
  dynamicSpreads: true,
  minSpreadBps: 30,
  maxSpreadBps: 100,
};
```

### Balanced strategy

Medium spreads with inventory management.

```typescript
const config = {
  market: marketPublicKey,
  quoteEdgeInBps: 25,
  quoteSizeInQuoteAtoms: 2_000_000_000,
  postOnly: true,
  priceImprovementBehavior: 'dime',
  inventorySkew: true,
  inventoryTarget: 50,
  skewMultiplier: 0.3,
};
```
