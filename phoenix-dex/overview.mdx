## Quick example

Initialize a market maker on Phoenix DEX.

```typescript
const config = {
  market: marketPublicKey,
  quoteEdgeInBps: 30, // 0.3% spread
  quoteSizeInQuoteAtoms: 1_000_000_000,
  postOnly: true,
  priceImprovementBehavior: 'dime' as const,
};

const tx = await sdk.phoenixMM?.initializeMarketMaker(
  trader.publicKey,
  config
);
```

## Market making strategies

### Post-only orders

Ensure orders are always maker orders.

```typescript
postOnly: true
```

### Price improvement

Choose how to improve on existing quotes:

- **Dime** - Improve by the minimum tick size
- **Join** - Match the best existing quote
- **Ignore** - Don't consider existing quotes

```typescript
priceImprovementBehavior: 'dime'
```
